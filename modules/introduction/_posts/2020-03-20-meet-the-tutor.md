# Sections

Sections are where the actual content for you course lives. Together they make up a bunch of modules and the modules together is what makes your course.

What content you put in your sections is up to you, it can be mostly textual, a tutorial like this section, a video, a project, or anything you'd like to use in your course.

## Add Content to Your Course

To add content, you need to create a section in a module. You can do so the same way you created a test section inside the introduction module before. Go to the folder for the module ex. [https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/tree/gh-pages/modules/introduction/_posts](https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/tree/gh-pages/modules/introduction/_posts) and create a new file for every section that you want within the module.
